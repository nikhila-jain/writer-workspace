To manage the technical documents that I would create.

## Naming Convention
Following naming convention might look like a cumbersome task, but it can help minimise the file access and management challenges.

### Guidelines
Follow these guidelines to name your technical documents:
* Short, but meaningful - You don't need to put a lot of description while naming your files, but the file names should be short yet meaningful that it conveys the purpose of the file.Long file names would mean long file path and long urls, and are prone to error. Long file names are difficult to remember and recognise and also have some limitations when you would want to share your files over emails.
** Some examples of file names could be:
    Correct - DesignPrinciplesJava.file-extension
    Incorrect - Design_Principles_Java_FrontEndPatterns_Overview.file-extensive

* Use alphanumeric characters - You should avoid using any special characters in your filename as some are reserved character by many operating systems and can cause broken links or access issues.

* Use underscores rather than spaces - Use underscores rather than spaces as spaces can cause path issues.

* Be consistent - Whichever guidelines you follow, it's important that you are consistent. This helps in any new member to understand and start contributing quick.
